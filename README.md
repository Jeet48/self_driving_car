# `Self-driving-car`



## This is the code I wrote during the Self-driving car (no libraries) JavaScript course:

## The code will appear as the course progresses and will be divided into parts as follows:

1)   Car driving mechanics
2)   Road definition
3)   Artificial sensors
4)   Collision detection
5)   Traffic simulation
6)   Neural network
7)   Visualizing neural networks
8)   Optimizing neural networks
9)   Fine-tuning
